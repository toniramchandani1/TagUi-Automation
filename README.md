README for Tagui python RPA tool

Tagui is a free and open-source robotic process automation (RPA) tool that allows users to automate repetitive tasks on their computer. Tagui is written in Python, and can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

## Installation
To install Tagui, follow the steps below:
1. Install Python version 3.7 or above on your computer.
2. Install the `tagui` package using the following command:
```
pip install tagui
```

## Usage
Tagui can be used to automate various tasks, such as web scraping, data entry, and report generation. Here's an example script that opens a website, fills in a form, and submits it:

```
import tagui as t

# open website
t.init()
t.url('https://www.example.com')

# fill in form
t.type('input[name="username"]', 'myusername')
t.type('input[name="password"]', 'mypassword')
t.click('button[type="submit"]')

# close browser
t.close()
```

This script initializes the Tagui library, opens the website, fills in the form fields, clicks the submit button, and then closes the browser.
